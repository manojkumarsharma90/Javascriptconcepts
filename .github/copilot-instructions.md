# Copilot Instructions for JsHindi

## Project Overview
This repository is a collection of JavaScript code examples and learning exercises, primarily focused on basic concepts, arrays, functions, and objects. Each file demonstrates specific language features or patterns for educational purposes.

## File Structure and Purpose
- `basic.js`: Demonstrates variable types, string methods, and Math functions.
- `arrays.js`: Shows array creation, manipulation, and the difference between `slice` and `splice`.
- `functions.js`: (Add new functions and examples here.)
- `objects.js`: (Add object-related examples here.)
- `arrays2.js`, `tempCodeRunnerFile.js`: Additional or temporary code.

## Coding Conventions
- Use clear, descriptive variable names relevant to the example.
- Each file should focus on a single JavaScript concept or related set of features.
- Prefer simple, self-contained code snippets for easy experimentation and learning.
- Use `console.log` for output and demonstration.
- Comment code to explain the purpose of each section or line, especially for non-obvious behavior.

## Developer Workflow
- No build or test system is present; run files directly with Node.js:
  ```powershell
  node basic.js
  node arrays.js
  # etc.
  ```
- No external dependencies or frameworks are used.
- Temporary or experimental code can be placed in `tempCodeRunnerFile.js`.

## Patterns and Examples
- Demonstrate both correct and incorrect usage (e.g., `undefined` vs. `not defined`, `slice` vs. `splice`).
- Use both array literals and constructors for variety.
- Show before/after states when mutating arrays or objects.

## Extending the Codebase
- Add new files for major topics (e.g., `loops.js`, `promises.js`).
- Keep each file focused and well-commented.
- Update this instruction file if new conventions or workflows are introduced.

## Key Files
- `basic.js`, `arrays.js`, `functions.js`, `objects.js`
